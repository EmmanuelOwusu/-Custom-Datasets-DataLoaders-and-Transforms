# -Custom-Datasets-DataLoaders-and-Transforms
This is a tutorial on writing  Custom Datasets, DataLoaders and Transforms.

A lot of effort in solving any machine learning problem goes in to preparing the data. 

PyTorch provides many tools to make data loading easy and hopefully, to make your code more readable. 

In this tutorial, we will see how to load and preprocess/augment data from a non trivial dataset.
